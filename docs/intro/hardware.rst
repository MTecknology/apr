Hardware Setup
==============

This is project is designed so that training takes place on a laptop/desktop
computer and the remainder will be deployed to a recording device.

.. _training:

Training Device
---------------

The cheapest laptop that can be found at any big box store should be more
than powerful enough for our needs. Training speed /may/ be increased with
a cuda-compatible device, but will ultimately provide identical results.

.. _recording:

Recording Device
----------------

Any modern single-board computer should be sufficient. The analytics and audio
processing is relatively light. It is recommended to use a high-quality USB
flash drive in addition to an SD card in order to support HD/4K video capture.

The hardware pictured below includes:

  - Raspberry Pi 5 8GB (Basic Kit)
    + Recommended OS: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
  - SanDisk 128GB High Endurance Video MicroSDXC Card
  - Angetube USB Microphone (w/ Gain Control)
  - ELP 4K HDMI USB Camera Wide Angle PC Camera
  - SanDisk 512GB Ultra Fit USB 3.2 Flash Drive (400MB/s) [not required]
